# <strong>Credits</strong>

Think of credits like prepaid phone balance but for your app. Instead of minutes or data, credits are what you “spend” whenever your app uses QuantumByte’s core features like AI or backend processing. This makes it easy to grow your app, you just top up credits as you need.

## <strong>Credit Usage</strong>
<div class="list-point">
  <p>Credits are consumed whenever your app does work in two main ways.</p>
  </div>

| Feature                  | Description                                                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AI Tokens**             | When your app communicates with the AI Models. Including when it generates your app and business concept or when the app goes live and your app uses AI Agent to assist your end users.|
| **Workload Units**  |When your app uses backend resources like CPU or Memory etc. You can think of this as every API request your app makes.|

<div class="list-point">
  <p>To see your Credits usage, you can go to the <strong>Billing > Usage History</strong>. From Usage History you can scroll down and see the detail of how your Credits are being consumed.</p>
  <p>Credits that you have purchased do not have any expiry dates. The Credits will be available as long as your account is active. If your account is closed or deactivated, unused credit cannot be refunded.
