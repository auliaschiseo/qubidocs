<p>Currently, payments on the QuantumByte platform can be made in two currencies: USD and IDR. For international users paying in USD, we support PayPal as the primary payment method.</p>
<p>For users in Indonesia paying in IDR, a variety of convenient local payment options are available. You can complete your payment through QRIS, DANA, OVO, GoPay, LinkAja, or via Bank Virtual Account (Mandiri, BNI, Permata Bank, BRI, and other supported banks).
