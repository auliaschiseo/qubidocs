# Fundamentals

Before you dive in, it’s important to understand the <strong>basic concept of QuantumByte</strong>:

<div align="justify">
<li><strong>Write a structured prompt in natural language.</strong> Simply describe your idea, who it’s for, and what problem it solves.</li>
<li><strong>QB automatically generates the foundation of your app</strong>, including the frontend (microsite), backend (microservices), data schema, CMS, and dashboard.</li>
- **Refine your app through natural language editing**, describe how you want your app to look and function and QuantumByte will translate it into a full functioning app with its structure, design, and logic.
- Beyond app-building, **QuantumByte helps you brainstorm business concepts and strategies** with features like Business Model Canvas and ROI calculation. It explores how your app will work, who it will serve, and how it can grow sustainably.

At its core, QuantumByte is an AI-powered no-code app builder. This means you can build complete applications without writing traditional code. Instead, you guide the system with prompts.

Prompting in natural language is not only for the initial app creation, it also applies to generating new features and designing the user interface (UI) in [Build Mode](). Prompts serve as the **highest level of customization**, allowing you to shape your app quickly and intuitively.

For users who want more control, QuantumByte also supports further **customization across different layers**. You can move from high-level prompting, down to editing features and data models, and finally to the [Code Editor]() for precise, low-level changes when needed. This layered approach gives flexibility: start simple with prompts, and go deeper only when necessary.
