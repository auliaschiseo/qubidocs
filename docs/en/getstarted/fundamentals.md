# <strong>Fundamentals</strong>

<div align="justify">
Before you dive in, it’s important to understand the <strong>basic concept of QuantumByte</strong>:
</div>

<div class="list-point" align="justify">
<li><strong>Write a structured prompt in natural language.</strong> Simply describe your idea, who it’s for, and what problem it solves.</li>
<li><strong>QB automatically generates the foundation of your app</strong>, including the frontend (microsite), backend (microservices), data schema, CMS, and dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Refine your app through natural language editing</strong>, describe how you want your app to look and function and QuantumByte will translate it into a full functioning app with its structure, design, and logic.</li>
<li><strong>Brainstorm business concepts and strategies</strong> with features like Business Model Canvas and ROI calculation. It explores how your app will work, who it will serve, and how it can grow sustainably.</li>

<p>At its core, QuantumByte is an AI-powered no-code app builder. This means you can build complete applications without writing traditional code. Instead, you guide the system with <a href="/getstarted/createapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prompts</a>.</p>

<p>Prompting in natural language is not only for the initial app creation, it also applies to generating new features and designing the user interface (UI) in <a href="https://quantumbyte.ai/auth/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Build Mode</a>. Prompts serve as the <strong>highest level of customization</strong>, allowing you to shape your app quickly and intuitively.</p>

<p>For users who want more control, QuantumByte also supports further <strong>customization across different layers</strong>. You can move from high-level prompting, down to editing features and data models, and finally to the <a href=" " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code Editor</a> for precise, low-level changes when needed. This layered approach gives flexibility: start simple with prompts, and go deeper only when necessary.</p>
